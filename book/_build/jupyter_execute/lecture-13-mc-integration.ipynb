    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply random sampling to calculate the overlap integral of two H 1s orbitals.\n",
    "2. Apply importance sampling to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return to the Overlap Integral\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture 5, we calculated the overlap integral of two H 1s orbitals using a grid-based numerical integration method. In this lecture, we will calculate the same integral using Monte Carlo integration. The integral we want to calculate is\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we will use random sampling to calculate the overlap integral. We will generate random points in the region $0 \\leq x \\leq 7 a_0$, $0 \\leq y \\leq 7 a_0$, and $0 \\leq z \\leq 7 a_0$. We will then calculate the value of the integrand at each point, average the value, and multiply by eight to get the integral. The code to do this is shown below."
