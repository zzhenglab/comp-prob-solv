    "# Project 2: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of a Polymer Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymer chains exhibit fascinating behaviors, including **temperature-driven phase transitions** between folded (globular) and unfolded (extended) states. Understanding these transitions is crucial in fields like biophysics, material science, and nanotechnology. MD simulations provide a powerful tool to study such phenomena at the molecular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write a Python program that performs MD simulations of a polymer chain at constant temperature and volume. You will model the polymer as a chain of beads connected by springs and subject to various interaction potentials. By varying parameters such as temperature and interaction strengths, you will simulate and observe the phase transition between the folded and unfolded states of the polymer.\n",

    "## Polymer Chain Model\n",

    "### Bead-Spring Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **bead-spring model**, a polymer chain is represented as a series of beads or monomers (red spheres in the figure below) connected by harmonic springs (gray lines). This simple yet effective model captures the essential features of polymer dynamics.\n",

    "2. **Non-Bonded Interactions**:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a chemical scientist at a space technology company dedicated to developing advanced materials for spacecraft. One of the challenges in space is the extreme temperatures, which can cause polymer materials to fold or become brittle, compromising their mechanical properties and reliability. Your team aims to design polymer materials that remain unfolded and maintain their structural integrity at the low temperatures encountered in space environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to simulate a polymer chain using molecular dynamics to understand how temperature affects its conformational behavior, with a focus on preventing folding at low temperatures. You will model the polymer chain as a series of beads connected by harmonic springs and include non-bonded interactions using Lennard-Jones potentials. By performing simulations at various space-relevant temperatures, you will analyze properties such as the radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, and potential energy to assess the linearity and stability of the polymer chain. Your findings will contribute to the design of polymers suitable for use in space technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will write a report summarizing your findings and discussing the implications for material design in the context of space applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",

    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  R_{\\text{ee}} = |\\mathbf{r}_N - \\mathbf{r}_1|\n",
