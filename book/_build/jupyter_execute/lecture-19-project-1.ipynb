    "# Project 1: Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations of Competitive Adsorption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In surface science, **competitive adsorption** refers to the scenario where multiple species (adsorbates) compete for adsorption sites on a surface. This phenomenon is crucial in heterogeneous catalysis, separation processes, and sensor technology, where the presence of one adsorbate can significantly influence the adsorption behavior of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write a Python program that uses the **grand canonical Monte Carlo** (GCMC) method and the **Metropolis algorithm** to simulate competitive adsorption of two different adsorbate species on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice. By varying parameters such as chemical potential, temperature, and interaction energies, you will compute the phase diagram of the system.\n",

    "You work for a chemical company that produces ammonia using the Haber-Bosch process. The company is interested in understanding the competitive adsorption of nitrogen and hydrogen on the catalyst surface to optimize the reaction conditions. Your task is to simulate the adsorption behavior of nitrogen and hydrogen on a 2D lattice and analyze the effects of varying chemical potentials and interaction energies. The company wants you to provide a detailed report on the phase diagram of the system and the implications for the ammonia synthesis process.\n",

You will vary the chemical potential of hydrogen ($\\mu_{\\text{H}}$) and hold the chemical potential of nitrogen ($\\mu_{\\text{N}}$) constant because nitrogen is in excess in the reaction. You do not know the exact values of the adsorption and interaction energies, so you will explore a range of parameters to understand the system's behavior. You will generate phase diagrams showing the coverage of nitrogen and hydrogen on the surface and analyze how different parameters affect the adsorption behavior. Finally, you will write a report summarizing your findings and discussing the implications for the ammonia synthesis process.\n",
