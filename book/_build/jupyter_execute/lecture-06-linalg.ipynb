    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Balance chemical equations** using algebraic methods and matrix representation.\n",
    "2. **Solve systems of linear equations** for stoichiometric coefficients using Python and NumPy.\n",
    "3. **Apply the null space method** to find balanced coefficients for chemical reactions.\n",
    "4. **Interpret and generalize solutions** to balance hydrocarbon combustion reactions and other chemical equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balancing Chemical Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chemical sciences, one of the foundational skills is **balancing chemical equations** to ensure that no mass is lost or created, as dictated by the law of conservation of mass. This process ensures that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the combustion of methane in oxygen:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\text{CH}_4(g) + b \\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow c \\text{CO}_2(g) + d \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the stoichiometric coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that balance the equation. We can do this systematically by ensuring the number of each type of atom is equal on both sides of the reaction. A useful approach is to create a table that tracks the number of atoms in the reactants and products for each element:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants       | Products         |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| C       | $a$             | $c$              |\n",
    "| H       | $4a$            | $2d$             |\n",
    "| O       | $2b$            | $2c + d$         |\n",
    "\n",
    "From this table, we can see the relationships between the variables. First, we know that for carbon to balance, $a = c$, since there is one carbon atom in both methane and carbon dioxide. Substituting this into the table gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants       | Products         |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| C       | $a$             | $a$              |\n",
    "| H       | $4a$            | $2d$             |\n",
    "| O       | $2b$            | $2a + d$         |\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we balance hydrogen. Since there are 4 hydrogen atoms in methane, and each water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms, we know that $4a = 2d$, which simplifies to $d = 2a$. Updating the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants       | Products         |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| C       | $a$             | $a$              |\n",

    "| O       | $2b$            | $2a + 2a = 4a$   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we balance oxygen. We have $2b$ oxygen atoms on the reactant side and $4a$ on the product side, so $2b = 4a$, meaning $b = 2a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substituting these values into the chemical equation, with $a = 1$ for simplicity, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CH}_4(g) + 2 \\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2(g) + 2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g)\n",

    "We can write the following set of equations based on the element balances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Carbon balance**: $a - c = 0$ (since there is one carbon atom in both methane and carbon dioxide)\n",
    "2. **Hydrogen balance**: $4a - 2d = 0$ (4 hydrogen atoms in methane, 2 per water molecule)\n",
    "3. **Oxygen balance**: $2b - 2c - d = 0$ (2 oxygen atoms in each oxygen molecule, balancing with oxygen in carbon dioxide and water)\n",
    "\n",
