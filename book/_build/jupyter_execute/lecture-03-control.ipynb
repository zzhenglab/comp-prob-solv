    "# Lecture 3: Control Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will explore one of the most crucial aspects of programming: control structures. Control structures are fundamental building blocks in Python, allowing you to control the flow of execution in your programs. By using these structures, you can make your code more dynamic, flexible, and responsive to different conditions and inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Control Structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures dictate the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated. They enable you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- Repeat actions or processes efficiently.\n",
    "- Organize code into reusable sections, making your programs more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Control Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are three main types of control structures that we will cover in this lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Statements:** These allow you to execute code only when certain conditions are met. This is essential for making decisions in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loops:** Loops enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is useful for tasks that require iteration, such as processing data sets or performing repetitive calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functions:** Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. This not only makes your code more organized but also facilitates code reuse and reduces redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and apply conditional statements to control the flow of execution in Python.\n",
    "- Utilize loops to efficiently repeat tasks and process collections of data.\n",
    "- Define and use functions to create reusable blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are essential in programming as they allow you to control the flow of your code based on specific conditions. In Python, the most common conditional statements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if` statement**\n",
    "2. **`if-else` statement**\n",
    "3. **`if-elif-else` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures enable your programs to make decisions and respond accordingly, making your code more dynamic and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is the simplest form of a conditional statement. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is true. The syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # block of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`condition`:** This is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "- If the `condition` is `True`, the block of code within the `if` statement is executed.\n",
    "- If the `condition` is `False`, the code block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3.3 Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They are often used for short, simple operations that are not reused elsewhere in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3.6 Best Practices for Using Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Descriptive Names:** Function names should clearly describe what the function does.\n",
    "2. **Keep Functions Small and Focused:** A function should do one thing and do it well. If your function is getting too long, consider breaking it up into smaller functions.\n",
    "3. **Document Your Functions:** Use docstrings to explain what your function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a Well-Documented Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(radius):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    float: The area of the circle.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return 3.14159 * radius ** 2\n",
