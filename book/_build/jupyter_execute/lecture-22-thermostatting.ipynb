    "# Chapter 21: Thermostatting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the concept of thermostatting in molecular dynamics simulations and its importance in maintaining constant temperature.\n",
    "2. Describe how the Andersen thermostat works and its impact on the system's dynamics.\n",
    "3. Implement the velocity Verlet algorithm combined with the Andersen thermostat in a 2D molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
    "4. Analyze the effects of thermostatting on energy conservation and temperature control in simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting the *Computational* Thermostat\n",
    "\n",
    "In molecular dynamics simulations, we often want to simulate a system at a **constant temperature**, corresponding to the canonical ensemble (NVT ensemble). However, when we numerically integrate Newton's equations of motion, the total energy of the system is conserved, leading to a microcanonical ensemble (NVE ensemble). To model real-world systems where temperature is controlled, we need to introduce **thermostats** that adjust the kinetic energy of the particles to maintain the desired temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermostatting involves coupling the system to an external **heat bath**, which can exchange energy with the system. This process allows the simulation to sample configurations according to the canonical distribution, enabling the study of temperature-dependent properties and phase behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Andersen Thermostat\n",
    "\n",
    "The Andersen thermostat is a stochastic method introduced by [Hans C. Andersen in 1980](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.439486) to maintain a constant temperature in MD simulations. It simulates the effect of collisions with an imaginary heat bath by randomly reassigning particle velocities, thus mimicking interactions with a thermal reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to occasionally interrupt the deterministic trajectory of particles by \"collisions\" with the heat bath:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each time step, each particle has a probability $\\nu \\Delta t$ of colliding with the heat bath, where $\\nu$ is the collision frequency.\n",
    "2. When a collision occurs, the particle's velocity is reassigned from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the desired temperature $T$.\n",
    "3. Particles not colliding continue their motion according to Newton's laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach maintains the correct canonical distribution of particle velocities and allows the system to equilibrate at the desired temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The Andersen thermostat disrupts the conservation of total momentum because velocities are randomly reassigned without regard to the system's overall momentum. This can affect properties dependent on momentum conservation, such as diffusion coefficients and flow behavior. If preserving momentum is critical for your simulation, consider using thermostats like the Nosé-Hoover thermostat, which conserves momentum while controlling temperature.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Velocity Verlet Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity Verlet algorithm is an integration scheme that updates both positions and velocities in a time-symmetric way, offering improved numerical stability and energy conservation compared to basic Verlet integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Algorithm Steps\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Position Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbf{r}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t)\\Delta t + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(t)}{2m}\\Delta t^2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "2. **Compute Forces:**\n",
    "   Calculate $\\mathbf{F}(t + \\Delta t)$ based on the updated positions $\\mathbf{r}(t + \\Delta t)$.\n",
    "3. **Velocity Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(t) + \\mathbf{F}(t + \\Delta t)}{2m}\\Delta t\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that the positions and velocities are updated consistently, providing accurate trajectories for the particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Velocity Verlet with Andersen Thermostat\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining the velocity Verlet algorithm with the Andersen thermostat, the velocity update step is adjusted to include stochastic collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Modified Velocity Update\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the standard velocity update,** apply the Andersen thermostat:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each particle, generate a random number $r$ between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- If $r < \\nu \\Delta t$, reassign the particle's velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t)$ from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified velocity update step becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(t) + \\mathbf{F}(t + \\Delta t)}{2m}\\Delta t + \\mathbf{R}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ is a random vector that is non-zero only if a collision occurs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawing Random Velocities from a Maxwell-Boltzmann Velocity Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw random velocities from a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution at the desired temperature, we can use `numpy.random.normal` to generate random numbers from a normal distribution and then scale them to have the desired temperature. The Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for a single dimension is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_v(v_x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_\\text{B}T}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_x^2}{2k_\\text{B}T}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $k_\\text{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The random velocities can be drawn from this distribution by generating random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sqrt{k_\\text{B}T/m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Andersen Thermostat in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the Andersen thermostat in 2D for a system of particles in a box. We will use the Lennard-Jones potential to calculate the forces between the particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will define a function to initialize the positions and velocities of the particles."

    "The snapshots illustrate how particles move and interact under the influence of the Lennard-Jones potential and the Andersen thermostat. Over time, the particles begin to form clusters because their initial separation distances are **greater than the equilibrium distance** of the Lennard-Jones potential, and the [temperature is relatively low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential#Thermophysical_properties_of_the_Lennard-Jones_substance). As the simulation progresses, the **attractive forces dominate**, drawing the particles closer together to minimize the system's potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the simulation were run for a longer duration, the particles would eventually coalesce into a single cluster. **This aggregation is driven by the particles seeking the potential energy minimum at the equilibrium separation distance.** Notice how the particles arrange themselves in a **hexagonally close-packed structure**, which is a common configuration in 2D systems with spherically symmetric interactions like the Lennard-Jones potential.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we explored the concept of **thermostatting** in molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the **Andersen thermostat**. We discussed how the Andersen thermostat maintains constant temperature by randomly reassigning particle velocities, simulating collisions with a heat bath.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented the Andersen thermostat in combination with the **velocity Verlet algorithm** for a 2D system of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. Through the simulation, we observed how the thermostat controls the temperature and affects energy conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results demonstrated effective temperature regulation and provided insights into the behavior of particles under thermostatting. We also discussed the limitations of the Andersen thermostat and briefly introduced alternative methods."
