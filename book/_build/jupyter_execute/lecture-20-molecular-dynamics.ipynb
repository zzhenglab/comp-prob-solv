The basic idea is to simulate the motion of atoms and molecules in a system by solving **Newton's equations of motion**. This is done by calculating the forces acting on each atom and molecule in the system and then using these forces to update the positions and velocities of the atoms and molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations are very similar to real experiments in that they provide a way to observe the behavior of atoms and molecules in a system over time.\n",
