    "# Chapter 20: Verlet Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Differentiate between conservative and non-conservative forces** and compute forces on a system of particles using potential energy functions.\n",
    "2. **Derive the Verlet integration algorithm** from the Taylor series expansion of particle positions.\n",
    "3. **Implement the Verlet algorithm** to simulate the motion of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential.\n",
    "4. **Calculate velocities and energies** within the Verlet framework to analyze kinetic, potential, and total energy conservation in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve Newton's equations of motion for a system of particles, we need to calculate the forces acting on each particle. These forces are then used to update the positions and velocities over time. Forces can be classified into two main types: **conservative forces** and **non-conservative (dissipative) forces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservative Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservative forces are those for which the work done moving an object between two points is independent of the path taken—it depends only on the initial and final positions. Examples include gravity, electrostatic forces, and elastic spring forces. Conservative forces depend solely on the positions of the particles. For such forces, we can define a potential energy function $U(\\mathbf{r})$ such that the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, *i.e.*,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the potential energy is defined up to an arbitrary constant, adding a constant to $U(\\mathbf{r})$ doesn't affect the force. In systems with only conservative forces, the total mechanical energy—sum of kinetic energy $T$ and potential energy $U$—is conserved, *i.e.*,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = T + U\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Conservation of Mechanical Energy\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "In an isolated system with only conservative forces, the total mechanical energy remains constant over time. However, if non-conservative forces are present or the system interacts with its surroundings, mechanical energy can change.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Conservative (Dissipative) Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-conservative or dissipative forces are forces for which the work done depends on the path taken and typically lead to a loss of mechanical energy from the system. This lost mechanical energy is usually transformed into other forms, such as heat. Examples include friction, air resistance, and viscous drag forces. In the presence of non-conservative forces, mechanical energy is not conserved, though the total energy (including all forms) remains constant.\n",
