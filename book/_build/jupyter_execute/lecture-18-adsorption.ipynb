    "# Chapter 18: Monte Carlo Simulations of Adsorption on Surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe the concept of adsorption and its importance in surface science.\n",
    "2. Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to study adsorption on surfaces.\n",
    "3. Analyze the results of a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the adsorption isotherm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Adsorption is the process by which molecules or atoms adhere to the surface of a solid or liquid. It plays a crucial role in various applications, such as catalysis, gas separation, and drug delivery. In this project, we will explore how to simulate adsorption on solid surfaces using Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adsorption on Surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Adsorption\n",
    "\n",
    "Adsorption on surfaces can be classified into three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physisorption**: In physisorption, molecules are held to the surface by weak van der Waals forces. This type of adsorption is reversible and does not involve the formation of chemical bonds between the adsorbate and the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chemisorption**: Chemisorption involves the formation of chemical bonds between the adsorbate and the surface. This type of adsorption is stronger than physisorption and can lead to irreversible changes in the adsorbate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dissociative Adsorption**: In dissociative adsorption, the adsorbate molecule dissociates into atoms or radicals upon adsorption. This process is common for molecules like hydrogen and oxygen on metal surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adsorption Isotherms\n",
    "\n",
    "The adsorption isotherm is a plot of the amount of adsorbate adsorbed on the surface as a function of pressure or concentration at constant temperature. The shape of the isotherm provides information about the adsorption mechanism and the surface properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lattice Gas Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lattice gas model, we represent the surface as a 2D lattice where each lattice site can be occupied by an adsorbate molecule. The adsorbate molecules interact with each other and with the surface through pairwise interactions. The energy of the system is given by the sum of these pairwise interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal Sorbent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model system, $N_s$ sorbent particles interact with $N_a$ adsorption sites on a solid surface but do not interact with each other."

    "In this lecture, we introduced the concept of adsorption on surfaces and discussed the importance of Monte Carlo simulations in studying adsorption phenomena. We implemented grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for ideal sorbent particles and sorbent particles with mean-field interactions on a square lattice. The simulations allowed us to calculate the adsorption isotherms of the systems and analyze the effects of chemical potential and interaction energies on the adsorption behavior.\n",

You will also learn how to analyze the simulation results and extract valuable information about the adsorption process.\n",
