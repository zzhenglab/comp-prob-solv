    "# Chapter 10: Statistical Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the microstate and macrostate of a system.\n",
    "2. Apply the Boltzmann distribution to calculate the probability of a system being in a given microstate.\n",
    "3. Explain the role of the partition function in calculating the thermodynamic properties of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we discussed the laws of thermodynamics, which describe the behavior of macroscopic systems in terms of energy, work, and heat. In this lecture, we will take a different approach to understanding thermodynamics by considering the behavior of individual particles that make up a system. This approach is known as **statistical thermodynamics** or **statistical mechanics**. Statistical thermodynamics provides a microscopic view of thermodynamic systems by considering the statistical distribution of particles in different energy states. By understanding the behavior of individual particles, we can derive macroscopic thermodynamic properties such as temperature, pressure, and entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microstates and Macrostates\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical thermodynamics, we distinguish between two important concepts: **microstates** and **macrostates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Difference between microstates and macrostates](microstate_macrostate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, a **microstate** refers to the specific configuration of a system at the microscopic level, including the positions and velocities of individual particles. For example, in a gas, a microstate would specify the position (center of each arrow) and velocity (direction of each arrow) of each gas molecule. A **macrostate**, on the other hand, refers to the overall properties of the system that can be observed and measured macroscopically, such as temperature, pressure, and volume. The macrostate of a system is determined by the collection of microstates that are consistent with the macroscopic properties of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boltzmann Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A **heat bath** is a large reservoir of particles at a constant temperature $T$ that can exchange energy with the system under consideration.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "For a closed system of fixed volume $V$, in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature $T$, the probability of finding the system in a particular microstate $i$ with energy $E_i$ is given by the **Boltzmann distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_i = \\frac{e^{-E_i/k_{\\rm B}T}}{Z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_{\\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the heat bath, and $Z$ is the partition function defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\sum_i e^{-E_i/k_{\\rm B}T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The partition function $Z$ is a normalization constant that ensures that the probabilities $P_i$ sum to 1 over all microstates of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Two-State System\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple two-state system with energies $E_1 = 0$ and $E_2 = \\epsilon$. The partition function for this system is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = e^{-0/k_{\\rm B}T} + e^{-\\epsilon/k_{\\rm B}T} = 1 + e^{-\\epsilon/k_{\\rm B}T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the system being in the ground state ($E_1 = 0$) is\n",

    "In this lecture, we introduced the concept of statistical thermodynamics, which provides a microscopic view of thermodynamic systems by considering the statistical distribution of particles in different energy states. We discussed the distinction between microstates and macrostates and introduced the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the probability of a system being in a given microstate. We also introduced the partition function, which is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of a system, such as the average energy, heat capacity, free energy, and entropy. By understanding the behavior of individual particles in a system, we can derive macroscopic thermodynamic properties and gain insights into the behavior of complex systems."
