    "# Lecture 16: Technical Details: Boundary Conditions, Truncation of Interactions, *Etc.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the importance and implementation of periodic boundary conditions in molecular simulations.\n",
    "2. Apply the minimum image convention to compute the shortest distance between particles under periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "3. Understand and implement interaction truncation methods, including the use of shift functions to handle discontinuities in potential energy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating physical systems at the atomic or molecular level involves managing interactions among a vast number of particles. Directly simulating all these particles is computationally infeasible. To address this challenge, we use techniques such as **periodic boundary conditions** and **interaction truncation** to make simulations manageable while still capturing essential physical behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Periodic Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider simulating a macroscopic amount of a substance, like a glass of water, at atomic-level precision. A typical glass contains about 250 mL of water. The number of atoms in such a volume can be estimated\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Number of atoms} &= 250 \\, \\text{mL} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{g}}{1 \\, \\text{mL}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mol}}{18 \\, \\text{g}} \\times \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{molecules}}{1 \\, \\text{mol}} \\times \\frac{3 \\, \\text{atoms}}{1 \\, \\text{molecule}} \\\\\n",
    "&\\approx 2.5 \\times 10^{25} \\, \\text{atoms}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating this many atoms directly is beyond current computational capabilities. However, we can exploit the fact that many interactions are **short-ranged**, decaying rapidly with distance. This allows us to simulate a smaller, representative system (typically between $10^3$ and $10^9$ atoms) by applying **periodic boundary conditions (PBCs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept of Periodic Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "PBCs mimic an infinite system by repeating a finite simulation box in all spatial directions. Each particle interacts not only with other particles within the box but also with the periodic images of particles in neighboring boxes. This setup eliminates surface effects that would otherwise arise from the finite size of the simulation box.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Periodic boundary conditions](pbc_2d_example_colored.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **central box** is the simulation box and the **surrounding boxes** are periodic images. When a particle moves out of the simulation box, it re-enters from the opposite side, maintaining a constant number of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum Image Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "When using PBCs, calculating distances between particles requires careful consideration to ensure interactions are computed correctly. Simply using positions within the simulation box might not yield the shortest distance due to periodic images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the Minimum Image Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The **minimum image convention** states that the distance between two particles should be the shortest distance considering all periodic images. For a box with edge length $L$, the minimum image distance $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}$ between particles at positions $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2 - L \\cdot \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2}{L}\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{round}$ operates element-wise on vector components, rounding to the nearest integer. This formula maps the displacement vector into the range $\\left(-\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}\\right]$, ensuring it corresponds to the minimum image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the Minimum Image Convention in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the minimum image convention in Python for a two-dimensional system."
