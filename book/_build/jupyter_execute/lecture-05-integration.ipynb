    "# Chapter 5: Chemical Bonding and Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The covalent bond plays a central role in the chemical sciences, dictating the chemical and physical properties of organic matter. It also plays an important role in inorganic, solid-state, and materials chemistry. The covalent bond is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where electrons in atomic orbitals are shared between atoms, causing these atomic orbitals to hybridize and form molecular orbitals. The hybridization of atomic orbitals is primarily governed by the energetic similarity of the atomic orbitals involved and their spatial proximity and orientation. In quantum chemistry, the latter is quantified using the overlap integral, which takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\psi_i^*(r, \\theta, \\phi) \\psi_j(r, \\theta, \\phi) r^2 \\sin(\\theta) dr d\\theta d\\phi\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$ are the atomic orbitals of atoms $i$ and $j$, respectively. These atomic orbitals are written in spherical coordinates, where the volume element of integration is $r^2 \\sin(\\theta) dr d\\theta d\\phi$. We will come back to this, but first, let us discuss what an integral is.\n",

    "## Analytical vs. Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is an Integral?\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition of a *Riemann integral* is the limit of the sum of areas of rectangles under a curve. The integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, an integral is a sum with really small increments (*i.e.*, as small as possible). Therefore, calculating an integral numerically amounts to computing the area of a series of rectangles along $x$, where the height of the rectangle is the function $y$ value at that point. There are several methods to achieve an accurate value of the integral with the fewest number of computations, such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature. In this lecture, we will focus on the Riemann sum when we write our integration codes and then move on to the trapezoidal rule implemented in Scipy and NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the function $f(x) = x^2$ over the interval $[0, 1]$. The integral of this function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_0^1 x^2 dx = (1/3) x^3 \\Big|_0^1 = 1/3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate this integral numerically using a Riemann sum with 10, 100, and 1000 rectangles."

    "The plot shows that the overlap integral decreases as the separation distance between the two hydrogen atoms increases. The analytical solution, the Riemann sum, and the trapezoidal rule all give consistent results, with the trapezoidal rule being the most accurate. The analytical solution provides a reference for the accuracy of the numerical methods.\n",
