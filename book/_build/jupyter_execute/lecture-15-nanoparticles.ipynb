    "# Chapter 15: Nanoparticle Shape and Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe how the shape of nanoparticles influences their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties.\n",
    "2. Explain the principles of simulated annealing and how it can be used to find the optimal shape of a nanoparticle.\n",
    "3. Implement simulated annealing to optimize a system of interacting particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nanoparticle Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of a nanoparticle plays a crucial role in determining its properties. Due to their small size and high surface-to-volume ratio, nanoparticles exhibit unique behaviors compared to bulk materials. The shape can affect\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optical Properties**: Nanoscale boundary conditions can lead to quantum confinement effects, altering the optical absorption and emission spectra.\n",
    "- **Mechanical Properties**: The truncation of long-range interactions and the presence of surface atoms can change the stiffness and strength of nanoparticles.\n",
    "- **Chemical Properties**: The number and arrangement of surface atoms influence reactivity and catalytic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and controlling nanoparticle shape is essential for applications in drug delivery, catalysis, photonics, and materials science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local vs. Global Geometry Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "When optimizing the geometry of a nanoparticle or any complex system, we aim to find the configuration that minimizes the system's potential energy. However, potential energy surfaces often contain multiple local minima due to the complex interactions between particles. **Local optimization algorithms**, such as gradient descent or methods implemented in [`scipy.optimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html#local-multivariate-optimization), can efficiently find a nearby minimum but may get trapped in a local minimum rather than finding the global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Illustration of Local vs. Global Minima](local_minimum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, a local optimization algorithm starting at $\\mathbf{3.5}$ may converge to the local minimum at $\\color{red} \\mathbf{2}$, missing the global minimum at $\\color{blue} \\mathbf{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations of local optimization, we use **global optimization algorithms** that can escape local minima. **Simulated annealing** is a probabilistic technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where controlled cooling allows atoms to reach lower energy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated annealing adapts the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from statistical mechanics. The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial configuration and a high \"temperature\" parameter.\n",
    "2. **Temperature Schedule**: Define a cooling schedule to gradually reduce the temperature.\n",
    "3. **Generation of New Configurations**: At each step, generate a new configuration by making a random change to the current configuration.\n",
    "4. **Energy Calculation**: Compute the change in energy, $\\Delta E$, between the new and current configurations.\n",
    "5. **Acceptance Criterion**: Accept the new configuration with probability\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(\\text{accept}) =\n",
    "   \\begin{cases}\n",
    "   1, & \\text{if } \\Delta E \\leq 0 \\\\\n",
    "   \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}\\right), & \\text{if } \\Delta E > 0\n",
    "   \\end{cases}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $k_\\text{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the current temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing occasional uphill moves (accepting higher energy states), the algorithm can escape local minima and explore the configuration space more thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Optimizing the Shape of a Nanoparticle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We will optimize the configuration of a cluster of five argon atoms interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. One atom is fixed at the origin, and the other four are free to move. Our goal is to find the arrangement that minimizes the total potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lennard-Jones Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential models the interaction between a pair of neutral atoms or molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{\\text{LJ}}(r) = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{6} \\right]\n",

    "In this lecture, we explored the significance of nanoparticle shape in determining their properties and learned how global optimization algorithms like simulated annealing can be employed to find optimal configurations. Simulated annealing mimics the physical process of annealing, allowing the system to escape local minima and converge towards the global minimum by controlled cooling. By implementing this algorithm, we optimized a small cluster of Lennard-Jones particles, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems in the chemical sciences."
