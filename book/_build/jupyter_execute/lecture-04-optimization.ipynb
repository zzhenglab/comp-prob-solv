    "# Chapter 4: Chemical Reaction Equilibria and Roots of Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and apply the concept of chemical equilibrium.\n",
    "- Formulate and solve equilibrium problems analytically.\n",
    "- Utilize numerical methods, including `scipy.optimize.minimize`, to find roots of equations in chemical equilibrium problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Chemical Reaction Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chemical sciences, understanding the equilibrium state of a reaction is essential for predicting the final concentrations of reactants and products in a system. The equilibrium state occurs when the [rates](https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.R05156) of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of the species involved. This state is also characterized by the minimization of the system's free energy, often represented by the [Gibbs free energy](https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.G02629) under conditions of constant temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a classic example of chemical equilibrium, the dissociation of water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen gases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2 \\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{O}_2(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At equilibrium, the reaction mixture obeys the [law of mass action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action), which relates the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the species to the equilibrium constant, $K_P$. The equilibrium constant is a quantity characterizing the extent to which a reaction proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation of Equilibrium Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium constant $K_P$ for a reaction is defined as the ratio of the product of the partial pressures of the products to the reactants, each raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients. For the reaction given above, $K_P$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K_P = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{H}_2}}{P^{\\circ}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{O}_2}}{P^{\\circ}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{P^{\\circ}}\\right)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P_{\\text{H}_2}$, $P_{\\text{O}_2}$, and $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$ are the partial pressures of hydrogen, oxygen, and water vapor, respectively, and $P^{\\circ}$ is the standard pressure, *i.e.*, 1 bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the equilibrium state, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table, which helps in setting up the mathematical expressions for the equilibrium concentrations or partial pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we start with 2 moles of water vapor in a closed system. At equilibrium, the changes in the number of moles of each species can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                            | $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$       | $\\text{H}_2$         | $\\text{O}_2$        |\n",
    "|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Initial (mol)**          | 2                          | 0                    | 0                   |\n",
    "| **Change (mol)**           | $-2x$                      | $+2x$                | $+x$                |\n",
    "| **Equilibrium (mol)**      | $2 - 2x$                   | $2x$                 | $x$                 |\n",
    "| **Partial Pressure (bar)** | $\\frac{2 - 2x}{2 + x} P$   | $\\frac{2x}{2 + x} P$ | $\\frac{x}{2 + x} P$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial:** The starting number of moles of each species before the reaction reaches equilibrium.\n",
    "- **Change:** The change in the number of moles of each species as the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium. Here, $x$ represents the extent of the reaction.\n",
    "- **Equilibrium:** The number of moles of each species at equilibrium.\n",
    "- **Partial Pressure:** The partial pressure of each species at equilibrium, assuming the total pressure is $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving for Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for the equilibrium partial pressures (or concentrations), you would typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the expression for the equilibrium constant $K_P$ using the equilibrium partial pressures.\n",
    "2. Substitute the expressions from the ICE table into the $K_P$ equation.\n",
    "3. Solve the resulting equation for $x$, the extent of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process often involves solving a nonlinear equation, which can be done analytically for simple cases or numerically for more complex reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Methods for Finding Roots of Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional numerical root-finding algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Bisection Method](https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter19.03-Bisection-Method.html):** Iteratively narrows down the interval where a root lies by evaluating the midpoint.\n",
    "- **[Newton-Raphson Method](https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter19.04-Newton-Raphson-Method.html):** Uses the derivative of the function to quickly converge to a root, requiring an initial guess.\n",
    "- **[Secant Method](https://patrickwalls.github.io/mathematicalpython/root-finding/secant/):** Approximates the derivative using finite differences, avoiding the need for explicit derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `scipy.optimize.minimize`: A Versatile Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "[`scipy.optimize.minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize) is a powerful optimization tool that, while not a traditional root-finding algorithm by design, can be adapted to find roots by minimizing the absolute value of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad Applicability:** Suitable for complex, multi-variable problems.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Can work without explicit derivatives and allows for the inclusion of constraints.\n",
    "- **Versatility:** Effective in a wide range of practical applications, particularly in chemical systems where certain parameters must remain within physical bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Root-Finding Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the process of finding roots using Python, let's solve a simple quadratic equation both analytically and numerically. Consider the quadratic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the quadratic formula, the roots are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}}{2 \\cdot 1} = 2, 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we find these roots numerically, let's visualize the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2$ using Matplotlib to see where the roots lie. The roots are the points where the curve intersects the x-axis."
