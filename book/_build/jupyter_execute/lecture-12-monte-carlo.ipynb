    "# Lecture 12: The Monte Carlo Method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the basic principles of the Monte Carlo method.\n",
    "2. Apply Monte Carlo sampling to estimate integrals.\n",
    "3. Explain the concept of importance sampling and its benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Monte Carlo Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Monte Carlo method** is a powerful computational technique used to solve problems by relying on random sampling. To illustrate its basic idea, let’s start with a simple example: evaluating the integral of $ f(x) = x^2 $ over the interval $[0, 1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\int_0^1 x^2 \\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relating Integrals to Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the average value of a function $ f(x) $ over an interval $[a, b]$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle f(x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can write the integral as the average of $ x^2 $ over $[0, 1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\int_0^1 x^2 \\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of solving this integral analytically, we can approximate it by randomly sampling points from the interval $[0, 1]$ and evaluating $ x^2 $ at those points. This is the essence of the **Monte Carlo method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we generate $ N $ random numbers $ x_i $ uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. We can approximate the integral as the average of $ x_i^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us an estimate for the integral. The larger the number of random samples $ N $, the closer the estimate gets to the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python code demonstrates how to estimate the integral using Monte Carlo sampling."

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a uniform distribution, the Monte Carlo estimator would directly sample from this integral. However, efficiency can be improved by selecting a distribution that matches the behavior of the integrand, *i.e.*, a distribution that emphasizes regions where $x^2$ is larger. This results in a smaller variance of the estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewriting the Integral\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the integral as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^2}{g(x)} g(x) \\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g(x)$ is any probability distribution (with support over [0, 1]) that can be used to sample points more efficiently. The idea is to choose a $g(x)$ that is similar to the shape of the function $x^2$. This way, the sampling is concentrated in regions where the function $x^2$ contributes more to the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a Suitable $g(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A good candidate for $g(x)$ is the **Beta distribution** with parameters $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 1$. The probability density function of the Beta distribution is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(x) = \\frac{x^{\\alpha - 1} (1 - x)^{\\beta - 1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $B(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the Beta function, and in this case, it biases the samples toward larger values of $x$, aligning well with the shape of $x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Estimator with Importance Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Beta distribution, the integral can be approximated as\n",
