# Project 1: Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations of Competitive Adsorption

## Introduction

In surface science, **competitive adsorption** refers to the scenario where multiple species (adsorbates) compete for adsorption sites on a surface. This phenomenon is crucial in heterogeneous catalysis, separation processes, and sensor technology, where the presence of one adsorbate can significantly influence the adsorption behavior of another.

In this project, you will write a Python program that uses the **grand canonical Monte Carlo** (GCMC) method and the **Metropolis algorithm** to simulate competitive adsorption of two different adsorbate species on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice. By varying parameters such as chemical potential, temperature, and interaction energies, you will compute the phase diagram of the system.

Consider a 2D square lattice representing the surface, where each lattice site can be **empty** (white squares in the left panel), occupied by **adsorbate A** (blue circles), or occupied by **adsorbate B** (red circles). The adsorption behavior is governed by adsorption energies $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$ (middle panel) and interaction energies $\epsilon_{AA}$, $\epsilon_{BB}$, and $\epsilon_{AB}$ (right panel).

### Lattice Model for Two Species

In this lattice model, the total energy of the system is given by

$$
E = \sum_{i} \left( n_i^A \epsilon_A + n_i^B \epsilon_B \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( n_i^A n_j^A \epsilon_{AA} + n_i^B n_j^B \epsilon_{BB} + n_i^A n_j^B \epsilon_{AB} + n_i^B n_j^A \epsilon_{AB} \right)
$$

where $n_i^A$ and $n_i^B$ are the number of adsorbates A and B at site $i$, respectively. If site $i$ is empty, $n_i^A = n_i^B = 0$. If site $i$ is occupied by adsorbate A, $n_i^A = 1$ and $n_i^B = 0$. If site $i$ is occupied by adsorbate B, $n_i^A = 0$ and $n_i^B = 1$. The first sum runs over all lattice sites, and the second sum runs over all pairs of neighboring sites. The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ avoids double-counting interactions.

### Grand Canonical Ensemble

In the grand canonical ensemble, this system is open to exchange particles and energy with a reservoir at fixed chemical potentials $\mu_A$ and $\mu_B$ for adsorbates A and B, respectively, and temperature $T$. The probability distribution function for the system is proportional to

$$
P(\{n_i^A, n_i^B\}) \propto \exp\left(-\beta \Omega\right)
$$

where $\Omega$ is the grand potential given by

$$
\Omega = E - \mu_A N_A - \mu_B N_B
$$

and $\beta = \frac{1}{kT}$ is the inverse temperature. The numbers of adsorbates A and B are denoted by $N_A$ and $N_B$, respectively.

## Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) Simulations

### Metropolis Algorithm Adapted for GCMC

In the grand canonical ensemble, the Metropolis algorithm is adapted to allow for particle addition and removal moves.

```{admonition} Particle Addition
1. Choose an empty site at random.
2. Decide to add A or B based on predefined probabilities or randomly.
3. Calculate the change in energy $\Delta E$.
4. Include the ratio of proposal probabilities in the acceptance probability.
5. Accept the move with probability

    $$
    \text{acc} = \min\left[1, \frac{N_a - N_s}{N_s + 1} \exp\left(-\beta [\Delta E - \mu_s]\right)\right]
    $$

    where $N_a$ is the number of empty sites, $N_s$ is the number of sites occupied by species $s$, and $\mu_s$ is the chemical potential of species $s$.

6. Update the lattice configuration and particle counts.
```

```{admonition} Particle Removal
1. Choose an occupied site at random.
2. Calculate the change in energy $\Delta E$ for removing the particle.
3. Include the ratio of proposal probabilities in the acceptance probability.
4. Accept the move with probability

    $$
    \text{acc} = \min\left[1, \frac{N_s}{N_a - N_s + 1} \exp\left(-\beta [\Delta E + \mu_s]\right)\right]
    $$

    where $N_a$ is the number of empty sites, $N_s$ is the number of sites occupied by species $s$, and $\mu_s$ is the chemical potential of species $s.

5. Update the lattice configuration and particle counts.

## Project Description

### Scenario

You work for a chemical company that produces ammonia using the Haber-Bosch process. The company is interested in understanding the competitive adsorption of nitrogen and hydrogen on the catalyst surface to optimize the reaction conditions. Your task is to simulate the adsorption behavior of nitrogen and hydrogen on a 2D lattice and analyze the effects of varying chemical potentials and interaction energies. The company wants you to provide a detailed report on the phase diagram of the system and the implications for the ammonia synthesis process.

You decide to use a grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation to model the competitive adsorption of nitrogen and hydrogen on a 2D square lattice. You will vary the chemical potential of hydrogen ($\mu_{\text{H}}$) and hold the chemical potential of nitrogen ($\mu_{\text{N}}$) constant because nitrogen is in excess in the reaction. You do not know the exact values of the adsorption and interaction energies, so you will explore a range of parameters to understand the system's behavior. You will generate phase diagrams showing the coverage of nitrogen and hydrogen on the surface and analyze how different parameters affect the adsorption behavior. Finally, you will write a report summarizing your findings and discussing the implications for the ammonia synthesis process.

You decide to explore the following sets of parameters:

- Ideal Mixture of Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
  - $\epsilon_{\text{N}} = -0.1$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{H}} = -0.1$ eV
  - $\epsilon_{\text{NN}} = 0$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{HH}} = 0$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{NH}} = 0$ eV
- Repulsive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
  - $\epsilon_{\text{N}} = -0.1$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{H}} = -0.1$ eV
  - $\epsilon_{\text{NN}} = 0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{HH}} = 0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{NH}} = 0.05$ eV
- Attractive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
  - $\epsilon_{\text{N}} = -0.1$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{H}} = -0.1$ eV
  - $\epsilon_{\text{NN}} = -0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{HH}} = -0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{NH}} = -0.05$ eV
- Immiscible Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
  - $\epsilon_{\text{N}} = -0.1$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{H}} = -0.1$ eV
  - $\epsilon_{\text{NN}} = -0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{HH}} = -0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{NH}} = 0.05$ eV
- "Like Dissolves Unlike" Scenario:
  - $\epsilon_{\text{N}} = -0.1$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{H}} = -0.1$ eV
  - $\epsilon_{\text{NN}} = 0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{HH}} = 0.05$ eV, $\epsilon_{\text{NH}} = -0.05$ eV

You will run the simulation for each set of parameters and generate phase diagrams showing the coverage of nitrogen and hydrogen on the surface. You will analyze the phase diagrams and discuss the implications of the results for the ammonia synthesis process. Your report should include figures of the phase diagrams and lattice configurations for each parameter set and a detailed discussion of the physical interpretation of the results. You should also discuss how the competitive adsorption behavior of nitrogen and hydrogen influences the ammonia synthesis process and suggest potential strategies for optimizing the reaction conditions.

### Optional Enhancements (Five Bonus Points Each)

- Implement additional moves such as particle swaps to enhance the simulation.
- Explore more complex lattice geometries (e.g., triangular or hexagonal lattices) and interaction schemes.
- Investigate the effects of lattice size on the adsorption behavior and phase diagrams.
- Extend the simulation to include more than two adsorbate species and study the competitive adsorption behavior.
- Implement a visualization tool to animate the adsorption process and observe the stochastic behavior of the system.
