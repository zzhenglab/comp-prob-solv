# Chapter 13: Monte Carlo Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to

1. Apply random sampling to calculate the overlap integral of two H 1s orbitals.
2. Apply importance sampling to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo integration.

## Return to the Overlap Integral

In lecture 5, we calculated the overlap integral of two H 1s orbitals using a grid-based numerical integration method. In this lecture, we will calculate the same integral using Monte Carlo integration. The integral we want to calculate is

$$
S = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi_{1s}^*(x + R / 2, y, z) \psi_{1s}(x - R / 2, y, z) dx dy dz
$$

where $\psi_{1s}$ is the 1s orbital of hydrogen and $R$ is the distance between the two hydrogen atoms. We will set $R = 1 a_0$.

## Random Sampling

````{margin}
```{note}
We multiply by eight because we are only sampling in the first octant.
```
````

First, we will use random sampling to calculate the overlap integral. We will generate random points in the region $0 \leq x \leq 7 a_0$, $0 \leq y \leq 7 a_0$, and $0 \leq z \leq 7 a_0$. We will then calculate the value of the integrand at each point, average the value, and multiply by eight to get the integral. The code to do this is shown below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display, HTML

def psi_1s(x, y, z):
    """
    Calculate the value of the 1s orbital of hydrogen at a given point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float
        The x-coordinate of the point.
    y : float
        The y-coordinate of the point.
    z : float
        The z-coordinate of the point.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The value of the 1s orbital at the given point.
    """
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    value = (1 / (np.sqrt(np.pi))) * np.exp(-r)
    return value

# Set the random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Set the number of points to sample
n_points_list = [100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000]

# Set the integration limits
a = 0
b = 7

# Create lists to store the results
averages = []
std_devs = []

# Loop over the number of points to sample
for n_points in n_points_list:
    x = np.random.uniform(a, b, n_points)
    y = np.random.uniform(a, b, n_points)
    z = np.random.uniform(a, b, n_points)
    integrand = psi_1s(x + 0.5, y, z) * psi_1s(x - 0.5, y, z)
    integral = 8 * np.mean(integrand) * (b - a)**3
    variance = 8 * np.var(integrand) * (b - a)**3
    averages.append(integral)
    std_devs.append(np.sqrt(variance))

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.errorbar(n_points_list, averages, yerr=std_devs, fmt='o-')
plt.axhline(0.858385, color='black', linestyle='--', label='Exact Value')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Number of Points Sampled')
plt.ylabel('Integral Value')
plt.title('Overlap Integral of Two H 1s Orbitals')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The plot above shows the value of the integral as a function of the number of points sampled. The exact value of the integral is shown as a dashed line. As you can see, the value of the integral converges to the exact value as the number of points sampled increases.

## Importance Sampling

Next, we will use importance sampling to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo integration. We will sample points from a distribution that is proportional to the integrand, rather than a uniform distribution.

---

### Choosing the Importance Sampling Distribution

To choose the importance sampling distribution, we need to find a function $g(x, y, z)$ that is proportional to the integrand $\psi_{1s}^*(x + R / 2, y, z) \psi_{1s}(x - R / 2, y, z)$. We can do this by noting that the integrand is a product of two 1s orbitals, which are spherically symmetric. Therefore, we can choose the importance sampling distribution to be a spherically symmetric distribution. One possible choice is the exponential distribution

$$
g(x, y, z) = \exp(-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})
$$

Let's plot the integrand and the importance sampling distribution to see if they are similar.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.stats import expon

# Plot the integrand and the importance sampling distribution
x = np.linspace(0, 7, 100)
y = 0
z = 0
integrand = psi_1s(x + 0.5, y, z) * psi_1s(x - 0.5, y, z)
importance_sampling = expon.pdf(x)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x, integrand, label='Integrand')
plt.plot(x, importance_sampling, label='Importance Sampling Distribution')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Integrand and Importance Sampling Distribution')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

As you can see from the plot above, the integrand and the importance sampling distribution are similar, which means that the importance sampling distribution is a good choice.

---

To use importance sampling, we need to modify the Monte Carlo integration code to sample points from the importance sampling distribution. The code to do this is shown below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Set the number of points to sample
n_points_list = [100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000]

# Create lists to store the results
averages = []
std_devs = []

# Loop over the number of points to sample
for n_points in n_points_list:
    x = expon.rvs(size=n_points, scale=1)
    y = expon.rvs(size=n_points, scale=1)
    z = expon.rvs(size=n_points, scale=1)
    numer = psi_1s(x + 0.5, y, z) * psi_1s(x - 0.5, y, z)
    denom = expon.pdf(x) * expon.pdf(y) * expon.pdf(z)
    integrand = numer / denom
    integral = 8 * np.mean(integrand)
    variance = 8 * np.var(integrand)
    averages.append(integral)
    std_devs.append(np.sqrt(variance))

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.errorbar(n_points_list, averages, yerr=std_devs, fmt='o-')
plt.axhline(0.858385, color='black', linestyle='--', label='Exact Value')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Number of Points Sampled')
plt.ylabel('Integral Value')
plt.title('Overlap Integral of Two H 1s Orbitals (Importance Sampling)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The plot above shows the value of the integral as a function of the number of points sampled using importance sampling. The exact value of the integral is shown as a dashed line. As you can see, the value of the integral converges to the exact value much faster using importance sampling compared to random sampling.

## Summary

In this lecture, we used Monte Carlo integration to calculate the overlap integral of two H 1s orbitals. We first used random sampling and then improved the efficiency of the calculation using importance sampling. We found that importance sampling converges to the exact value much faster than random sampling.
