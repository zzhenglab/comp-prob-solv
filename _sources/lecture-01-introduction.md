## Step 3: Let's Get Started with Python

### 3.1 Python and Mathematics

Python is a versatile programming language that excels at solving a wide range of problems in the chemical sciences, particularly when it comes to mathematical computations. Whether you're performing simple arithmetic or tackling more advanced calculus, Python is equipped to handle it all.

Let’s start with some basic math operations in Python:

- **Addition:** You can add two numbers easily:

```{code-cell} ipython3
2 + 2
```

- **Multiplication:** Multiplication is just as straightforward:

```{code-cell} ipython3
3 * 4
```

Python supports a variety of mathematical operations, including:

- **Subtraction:** `a - b`
- **Division:** `a / b`
- **Exponentiation:** `a ** b` (which gives $a^b$)

````{margin}
```{note}
The `math` module is a built-in library in Python. To use it, you must first import it using the `import` statement. Once imported, you can access various mathematical functions and constants by prefixing them with `math`. For more details, refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html).
```
````

Python's capabilities extend far beyond basic arithmetic. For example, to calculate the square root of a number, you can use the `math` module:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math
math.sqrt(9)
```

In this example, you’ve seen your first instance of importing a module in Python. The `import` statement allows you to bring additional functionality into your Python programs. In this case, by importing the `math` module, you gain access to a suite of mathematical tools that go beyond basic operations.

Once imported, you can use any function from the module by prefixing it with `math`. For instance, `math.sqrt()` is the function to compute the square root.

### 3.2 Practice Exercises

Let’s put this into practice with a couple of exercises:

1. **Exercise 1:**
   Calculate the value of $2^3 + 4^2$ using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   You can use the `**` operator for exponentiation.
   ```

2. **Exercise 2:**
   Calculate the value of $\sqrt{16} + \sqrt{25}$ using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   Remember to use the `math.sqrt()` function for square roots.
   ```

---

### 3.3 Python Can Do Chemistry

Python is not just a powerful tool for mathematics; it can also be used to solve a wide range of problems in chemistry. Whether you're performing basic stoichiometric calculations or exploring complex quantum chemistry, Python has you covered.

For example, let’s calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$):

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_mass = 12.011
oxygen_mass = 16.00
molar_mass = carbon_mass + 2 * oxygen_mass
molar_mass
```

In this example, you've encountered your first use of variables in Python. A variable is simply a name that refers to a value. You can use variables to store values and perform calculations. In this case, we stored the atomic masses of carbon (`carbon_mass`) and oxygen (`oxygen_mass`) as variables, and then used these to calculate the molar mass of CO$_2$.

Python can also help you determine the number of moles of a compound:

```{code-cell} ipython3
mass = 10.0
molar_mass = 44.01
moles = mass / molar_mass
moles
```

As you can see, Python allows you to easily perform all kinds of chemical calculations. Each variable in Python has a data type, which determines the kind of data it can hold. In the above example, `mass` and `molar_mass` are of type `float`, meaning they represent real numbers. The result of the division operation (`moles`) is also a `float`.

You can determine the data type of any variable using the `type()` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(mass)
```

### 3.4 Practice Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:**
   Calculate the molar mass of water (H$_2$O) using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   Remember that the atomic masses of hydrogen and oxygen are approximately 1.008 and 16.00, respectively.
   ```

2. **Exercise 2:**
   Calculate the number of moles of water (H$_2$O) in 100.0 grams of the compound using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   Use the molar mass you calculated in the previous exercise.
   ```

### 3.5 Python Can Do Graphing

Before we start creating plots, you'll need to ensure that Matplotlib is installed on your computer. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python that you'll be using frequently for data visualization. To install Matplotlib, open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, you can install Matplotlib directly within the notebook by running:

```ipython3
!pip install matplotlib
```

Once Matplotlib is installed, you're ready to start creating plots in Python. Let's start with a simple example of a line plot:

````{margin}
```{note}
The `$` symbols around the labels in the `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `title()` functions are used to render the text in LaTeX format, which is commonly used for mathematical expressions. This allows you to include mathematical symbols and equations in your plots. For more information on LaTeX formatting, refer to the [Overleaf documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions).
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

plt.plot(x, y)

plt.xlabel('$x$')
plt.ylabel('$y$')
plt.title('$y = x^2$')

plt.show()
```

In the first line, we encounter a new syntax: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. This statement means, "import the `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` library and give it the alias `plt`." The `pyplot` module is part of the `matplotlib` library, which is a powerful tool for creating a wide variety of graphs and plots.

In this example, we use the `plot()` function to create a line plot of the function $y = x^2$. We then use `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `title()` to label the x-axis, y-axis, and add a title to the plot, respectively. Finally, `show()` is used to display the plot.

Python offers several libraries for creating graphs and plots, each with its own strengths and use cases:

- **`matplotlib`:** Great for creating basic plots like line plots, scatter plots, and bar plots.
- **`seaborn`:** Built on top of `matplotlib`, it offers enhanced statistical plotting and a more attractive default style.
- **`plotly`:** Ideal for creating interactive and complex plots, including 3D plots.

You might find yourself experimenting with different libraries to determine which one best fits your specific needs.

### 3.6 Practice Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:**
   Create a line plot of the function $y = x^3$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   Modify the `y` values to reflect the function $y = x^3$.
   ```

2. **Exercise 2:**
   Create a scatter plot of the function $y = x^2$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ using Python.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   Use the `scatter()` function from `pyplot` to create the scatter plot.
   ```

3. **Challenge:**
   Create a plot that shows both $y = x^2$ and $y = x^3$ on the same graph. Use different colors and add a legend to differentiate between the two lines.

   ```{dropdown} Hint
   You can use the `plot()` function twice to plot both functions on the same graph. Use the `legend()` function to add a legend.
   ```
